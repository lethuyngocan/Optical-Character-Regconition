OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION WITH TESSERACT AND OPENCV

OCR: Detecting text content on images and converts it to machine-encoded text that we can access and manipulate in Python as a string variable. 

Application of OCR:
•	Passport recognition in Airports
•	Automation of Data Entry
•	License plates recognition

•	Creating Searchable PDFs
•	Create audible files (text to audio)
